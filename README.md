This app was created using Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

The object of the game is to match your score with the number that appears on the screen.
When you click the start button, a random number will appear. Your score will start at 0, once you begin clicking on crystals the score will increase by the value of the crystal. Each one has a different value and the value is not displayed to the user. If you get your score to match the number displayed, you win! If your score is greater than the number displayed, you lose. Your wins and losses will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.
